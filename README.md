# tedxtimer

A small Python (pygame) project that can be used as a speech timer for TedX style events.

It is controlled with the following keys:

* esc = quit
* r = reset to 10:00 and paused
* a = add 60 seconds to time remaining
* s = subtract 60 seconds from time remaining
* z = reset to 00:00 and paused
* space = pause/play
 
The screen goes red with 1 minute to go, then black-on-white if they go over time.
